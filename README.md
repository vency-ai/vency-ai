### 🧩 About Me

I'm a hands-on Solution Architect with a passion for building impactful, data-driven systems that improve how organizations operate—especially in healthcare and regulated industries. Over the years, I’ve led the design of AI-enabled platforms for patient risk scoring, predictive analytics, and care optimization, while working across finance, retail, and maritime domains as well.

I enjoy working at the intersection of AI, cloud-native technologies (AWS, Azure), and modern interoperability standards like FHIR. Whether it's integrating complex data across systems or leveraging generative AI to enhance clinical decisions, I focus on creating solutions that are secure, scalable, and built to last.
